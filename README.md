# Reconstructing Lensless Images in the Low-Data Regime

This code performs untrained iterative reconstruction of lensless images. By pre-training the network with as low as 10 examples only, we show that a huge performance improvement is achieved compared to its completely untrained counterpart. Our paper titled **Reconstructing Synthetic Lensless Images in the Low-data Regime** was accepted at the British Machine Vision Conference **(BMVC 2023)**. Please cite our paper if you wish to use our code.
